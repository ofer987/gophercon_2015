### Best About Go
- Constants

### Variables
- Declaring a variable initializing it.
- Default value is the 'zero' value
- Reference Types
- Has a header
 - Pointer to underlying byte array
- Length
- E.g.,
  - String
    - It is immutable
  - What is Type to the compiler
    - The length of memory
    - Representation of the memory
  - Cannot do casting
  - Struct Literals
  - Use var to declare variables
    - It initializes to the zero value
  - Compiler introduces padding between variables for alignment
  - *Mechanical sympathy* for free if follow convention and idioms
    - Then you can use a profiler for additional performance improvement
    - Copying fast data values is fast with today's hardware
    - Pass variables by
      - Value
      - Pointer
        - Pass the value of the address to a pointer variable
        - Pointer variables store an address
          - Declared with a *Star*
  - Stack and Heap
    - Goroutines are allocated 4k of memory
      - Reading a stack *goes down*
    - Heap uses *Mark and Sweep* algorithm
    - *& operator*:
      - Where is the box?
      - What is in the box?
