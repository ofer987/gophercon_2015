# Variables

- Declaring a variable initializing it.
- Default value is the 'zero' value
- Reference Types
- Has a header
 - Pointer to underlying byte array
- Length
- E.g.,
  - String
    - It is immutable
- What is Type to the compiler
  - The length of memory
  - Representation of the memory
- Cannot do casting
- Struct Literals
- Use var to declare variables
  - It initializes to the zero value
- Compiler introduces padding between variables for alignment
- *Mechanical sympathy* for free if follow convention and idioms
  - Then you can use a profiler for additional performance improvement
  - Copying fast data values is fast with today's hardware
  - Pass variables by
    - Value
    - Pointer
      - Pass the value of the address to a pointer variable
      - Pointer variables store an address
        - Declared with a *Star*
- Stack and Heap
  - Goroutines are allocated 4k of memory
    - Reading a stack *goes down*
  - Heap uses *Mark and Sweep* algorithm
  - *& operator*:
    - Where is the box?
    - What is in the box?
  - Do not use Println, it is a deprecated function for backwards-compatibility with version 1.0
Implementation
- go build -gcflags -m
  - To show internals of how program executes
- Implementation changes with version changes
- Do not code against implmentation: code against specification
